# Problem Statement: -

We know that as technology progresses, we are moving towards a world with lesser trust and more frequently occurring frauds. For example, when we order a product from any online store or offline store we doubt whether we will get the original product as promised. 
<br><br>
<br>

# Abstract: -

So to deal with the above problem we have introduced a project model based on web3 and blockchain technology that basically monitors the supply chain and brings transparency to the users. Here I have taken a use case of the supply chain that is the “Food supply chain” As we all know that health is the priority for all humans and to maintain that they need proper quality food, the food supply chain is complex but necessary food production arrangement required by the global community to maintain sustainability and food security. The supply chain has been extended geographically involving many more stakeholders, making the supply chain longer and complicated and thus involving many challenges. Some challenges faced by the traditional food supply chain are - 
1. Lack of traceability and communication.
2. Rising supply chain costs.
3. Supply of fraudulent food products
4. Failure of monitoring warehouses.
This blockchain-based food supply chaindeals with all the challenges faced by traditional food supply chains. This decentralized food supply chain is designed to trace the products from end to end and provide a smart and reliable way of providing information to the customers.

<br>

# Features: -

1. Platform to trace the food products worldwide
2. Restricting duplicate and unauthentic products
3. Proper food distribution
4. Reducing the supply chain cost
5. Making an automated chain
6. Securing the network using the blockchain protocols
7. Creating features of the reputation system

# The architecture of the system: -
1. Application layer
2. Blockchain layer
3. Infrastructure layer
